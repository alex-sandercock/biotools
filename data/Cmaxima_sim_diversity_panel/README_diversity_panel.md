# Atlantic Giant Pumpkin Diversity Panel - BIGapp Workshop Demo

## Overview
This simulated dataset represents a **GWAS diversity panel** of 200 Atlantic Giant pumpkin 
(*Cucurbita maxima*) accessions collected from breeding programs across the United States.

This dataset is designed to teach realistic GWAS concepts including:
- Population structure driven by geography
- A QTL peak with linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure
- The importance of LD pruning to identify independent signals

## Reference Genome

This dataset uses chromosome coordinates based on the **HZAU telomere-to-telomere assembly**:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Assembly | *C. maxima* HZAU (T2T, gap-free) |
| Total size | 345.14 Mb |
| Chromosomes | 20 |
| Scaffold N50 | 19.03 Mb |
| Reference | Zeng et al. (2024) Plant Communications |
| DOI | 10.1016/j.xplc.2024.100935 |

## Population Structure Model

The panel contains accessions from three geographic regions with distinct genetic backgrounds:

| Region | States | N | Mean Fruit Weight | Breeding Focus |
|--------|--------|---|-------------------|----------------|
| Eastern | NY, PA, OH, RI, CT, MA, NJ | 70 | ~1,065 lbs | Traditional giant pumpkin competitions |
| Midwest | WI, IA, IL, IN, MI, MN, NE, MO | 70 | ~965 lbs | Show & processing types |
| Western | CA, OR, WA, CO, AZ | 60 | ~895 lbs | Diverse newer breeding programs |

### How Structure Was Simulated
1. Three ancestral populations with different allele frequencies
2. Each sample has **admixture proportions** (Eastern_Ancestry, Midwest_Ancestry, Western_Ancestry columns)
3. Geography predicts ancestry, but with variation (gene flow between regions)
4. This creates **overlapping clusters** in PCA, not discrete groups

## Files

| File | Description | Size |
|------|-------------|------|
| `atlantic_giant_pumpkin_diversity.vcf` | Genotype data (GT:DP:AD format) | ~3 MB |
| `atlantic_giant_pumpkin_diversity_phenotypes.csv` | Sample metadata + phenotype | ~20 KB |
| `atlantic_giant_pumpkin_diversity_snp_info.csv` | SNP details + QTL annotations | ~75 KB |

## SNP Information

### Distribution
- **1,200 total SNPs** across 20 chromosomes (~60 per chromosome)
- **1,000 high-quality SNPs**: MAF > 0.05, missing < 10%
- **100 low-MAF SNPs**: MAF < 0.05 (for QC filtering demo)
- **100 high-missing SNPs**: >50% missing (for QC filtering demo)

**Note:** Poor-quality SNPs are randomly distributed across ALL chromosomes 
(~5 low-MAF and ~5 high-missing per chromosome). After filtering, each 
chromosome retains ~45-53 good-quality SNPs.

## QTL Region with LD Structure

### The Key Teaching Point
This dataset simulates a **realistic QTL peak** where multiple SNPs appear significant 
due to linkage disequilibrium, not because they are all causal.

### QTL Details (Chromosome 4)

| SNP | Position | Role | r² with Causal | Notes |
|-----|----------|------|----------------|-------|
| **SNP_0240** | 18,967,397 bp | **CAUSAL** | 1.00 | The TRUE QTL - only this SNP affects phenotype |
| SNP_0239 | 18,487,979 bp | Tag (LD) | 0.98 | ~479 kb from causal, significant due to LD |
| SNP_0238 | 18,109,217 bp | Tag (LD) | 0.90 | ~858 kb from causal, significant due to LD |

**Total QTL region span: ~858 kb**

### What This Teaches
1. **GWAS shows 3 significant SNPs** - but they're NOT 3 independent QTLs
2. **After LD filtering** - only 1 signal remains (the QTL region)
3. **Fine-mapping is needed** - to distinguish causal from tag SNPs
4. The causal SNP adds **150 lbs per alt allele** to fruit weight

## Expected Workshop Results

### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Color by Region:**
- Three overlapping clusters visible
- Eastern samples cluster together (but overlap with Midwest)
- Western samples form a separate cluster

**Color by State:**
- Geographic gradient becomes apparent

### 2. Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)

**Without kinship/structure correction:**
- Inflated test statistics across genome
- False positive signals

**With kinship correction:**
- Clear peak on Chromosome 4 with **3 significant SNPs**
- All 3 are within ~858 kb of each other

**After LD pruning/clumping:**
- Only **1 independent signal** remains
- This is your candidate QTL region
- The SNP info file tells you which one is truly causal

### 3. Quality Control Filtering

After applying filters:
- MAF < 0.05: Removes ~100 SNPs
- Missing > 50%: Removes ~100 SNPs  
- ~1,000 good-quality SNPs remain across all 20 chromosomes

## Workshop Teaching Points

### Why Diversity Panels for GWAS?
- Historical recombination breaks up LD → better resolution
- Many alleles segregating → can detect more QTLs
- BUT: population structure requires careful handling

### Key GWAS Concepts Demonstrated
1. Population structure causes spurious associations
2. Kinship matrices capture cryptic relatedness
3. Mixed models control false positives
4. **Multiple significant SNPs may represent ONE QTL due to LD**
5. LD pruning identifies independent signals
6. Fine-mapping needed to find causal variants

### Suggested Workshop Flow
1. Load data into BIGapp
2. Run PCA → show population structure by Region/State
3. Run GWAS without correction → see inflated results
4. Run GWAS with kinship → see clean Chr04 peak with 3 SNPs
5. Discuss LD filtering → explain why 3 SNPs = 1 QTL
6. Check SNP info file → reveal the causal variant
