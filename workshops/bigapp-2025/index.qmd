title: "Introduction to BIGapp for Plant Breeding"
subtitle: "Workshop Materials"
---

Welcome! This hands-on workshop introduces **BIGapp** — a free, web-based tool for analyzing genomic data in plant breeding programs. No coding required.

## Who Is This For?

This workshop is designed for:

- Undergraduate and graduate students in plant sciences
- Researchers working with genomic data in breeding programs
- Anyone interested in applying genomics to crop improvement

**No prior experience with R or bioinformatics is required.** BIGapp provides a point-and-click interface for analyses that traditionally require programming skills.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll understand:

1. **Why genomic data matters** for breeding decisions
2. **How to filter and quality-check** your genotyping data
3. **What population structure is** and how to visualize it with PCA
4. **How GWAS works** to find markers associated with traits

More importantly, you'll be able to do all of this yourself using BIGapp.

## Workshop Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours

**Format:** Live demonstration + hands-on practice

## Before the Workshop

::: {.callout-important}
## No installation required!
We'll use the **online version** of BIGapp, so you just need a web browser and internet connection.

If you'd like to install BIGapp locally for use after the workshop, see the [Setup Instructions](setup.qmd).

## Materials

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Setup Instructions](setup.qmd) | Optional local installation guide |
| [Module 1: Data & QC](module-01.qmd) | Import data, filter SNPs and samples |
| [Module 2: Population Structure](module-02.qmd) | Understand and run PCA |
| [Module 3: GWAS](module-03.qmd) | Find marker-trait associations |
| [Module 4: Genomic Selection](module-04.qmd) | *(Optional)* Predict breeding values |
| [Cheat Sheet](../../files/bigapp-cheatsheet.pdf) | Quick reference guide |

## Sample Data

We'll use example datasets built into BIGapp, so you don't need to download anything. After the workshop, you can try the same analyses with your own data!
