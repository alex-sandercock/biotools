The instructions below are for installing BIGapp on your own computer, which you might want to do after the workshop for working with your own data.

## Local Installation

### Step 1: Install R

Download and install R (version 4.4.0 or higher) from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

- [Download R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- [Download R for Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
- [Download R for Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)

### Step 2: Install BIGapp

Open R and run these commands:

```r
# Install required package managers
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
install.packages("remotes")

# Install BIGapp (this may take 10-20 minutes)
BiocManager::install("Breeding-Insight/BIGapp", dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Step 3: Run BIGapp

```r
library(BIGapp)
BIGapp::run_app()
```

BIGapp will open in your web browser.

## Installation errors?

Try installing in a fresh R session. If you still have issues:

1. Note the exact error message
2. [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Breeding-Insight/BIGapp/issues)
3. Include your operating system and R version (`R.version.string`)

## Mac M1/M2/M3 users

You may need Xcode command line tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## RStudio (Optional)

[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) provides a nicer interface for running R, but it's not required for BIGapp.
