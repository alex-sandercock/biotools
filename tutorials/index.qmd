## Sample Data

Sample datasets for these tutorials can be downloaded here:

**Atlantic Giant Pumpkin Diversity Panel** — A simulated GWAS dataset with 200 samples and 1,200 SNPs:

- [atlantic_giant_pumpkin_diversity.vcf.gz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alex-sandercock/biotools/main/data/Cmaxima_sim_diversity_panel/atlantic_giant_pumpkin_diversity.vcf.gz) (3 MB) — Genotype data in VCF format
- [atlantic_giant_pumpkin_diversity_phenotypes.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alex-sandercock/biotools/main/data/Cmaxima_sim_diversity_panel/atlantic_giant_pumpkin_diversity_phenotypes.csv) (20 KB) — Sample metadata and phenotypes
- [atlantic_giant_pumpkin_diversity_snp_info.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alex-sandercock/biotools/main/data/Cmaxima_sim_diversity_panel/atlantic_giant_pumpkin_diversity_snp_info.csv) (75 KB) — SNP details and annotations
- [README](https://github.com/alex-sandercock/biotools/blob/main/data/Cmaxima_sim_diversity_panel/README_diversity_panel.md) — Dataset documentation

Or load directly in R:

```r
# Example data is included in the package
library(toolone)
data("example_vcf")
```

## Prerequisites

These tutorials assume you have:

- R (≥ 4.0) and RStudio installed
- Basic familiarity with R syntax
- The following packages installed:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "vcfR", "toolone"))
```
