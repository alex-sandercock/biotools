## Overview

Binx is a command-line tool written in Rust for genomic analysis in polyploid and diploid species. It's designed for speed and efficiency when working with large genomic datasets.

## Key Features

- **High Performance** — Near C-level speed for computationally intensive tasks
- **Memory Safe** — No runtime overhead from garbage collection
- **Parallel Processing** — Safe concurrent processing of large files
- **Single Binary** — Easy deployment with no dependencies
- **Multi-ploidy Support** — Works with diploid and polyploid species
