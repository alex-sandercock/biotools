## Overview

BIGr is an R package developed by [Breeding Insight](https://breedinginsight.org/) that provides functions for analyzing genomic and pedigree data in diploid and polyploid breeding programs. It serves as the computational backbone for [BIGapp](bigapp.qmd) and can be used independently for scripted analyses.

## Key Features

- **Genotype Processing** — Quality control and filtering functions
- **Relationship Matrices** — Calculate genomic relationship matrices
- **Population Structure** — Tools for structure analysis
- **Format Conversions** — Convert between common genomic data formats
- **Polyploid Support** — Specialized functions for polyploid species
