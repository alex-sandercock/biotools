## Overview

castgen provides methods for estimating the number of individuals to sample from a population in order to capture a predefined percentage of genetic diversity. Originally developed for the American chestnut landscape genomics project, it's useful for conservation genetics and breeding program design.

## Key Features

- **VCF or Matrix Input** — Accepts VCF files or genotype matrices
- **Fast Computation** — Parallel processing support
- **Confidence Intervals** — Statistical bounds on sample size estimates
- **R Reimplementation** — Much faster than the original Python version

## Use Cases

- **Conservation genetics** — Minimum sample size for seed banks or germplasm collections
- **Breeding programs** — Plan crossing schemes that maintain diversity
- **Population studies** — Optimize sampling strategies for surveys
