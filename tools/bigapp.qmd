## Overview

BIGapp (Breeding Insight Genomics app) is a web application built with R and Shiny that simplifies the processing of low to mid-density genotyping data for both diploid and polyploid species. It provides an intuitive interface for researchers and breeders to analyze genomic data without requiring command-line expertise.

## Key Features

- **Web-Based Interface** — Access through your browser, no command-line needed
- **Genotype Processing** — Call genotypes from read counts, filter SNPs and samples
- **Summary Statistics** — SNP PIC, MAF, observed heterozygosity
- **Population Structure** — PCA and DAPC analysis
- **GWAS** — Genome-wide association studies via GWASpoly
- **Genomic Selection** — Model accuracy estimation, predict breeding values
- **Multi-ploidy Support** — Works with diploid and polyploid species
